# Pig-Game
A simple pig game made using Javascript 
                                                     
Thanks to Jonas Schmedtmann's course about Javascript, during last quarantine fortunately, I made it this far and started following the course's projects which the "Pig Game" had a special place in it.

The game has new features rules :
1. A player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 6 in a row. After that, it's the next player's turn. 
2. the players can set the winning score, so that they can change the predefined score of 100. 
3. Add another dice to the game, so that there are two dices now. The player looses his current score when one of them is a 1.
